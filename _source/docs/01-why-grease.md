title: Why Grease?
---
**Grease** takes the friction out of building fast, accessible, aesthetic websites. It combines [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/), & [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) with a modern, declarative CSS architecture that sets you up for success. Key benefits:

- **Fast in-browser design.**
  Fast tools (11ty, Esbuild, Lightning CSS) and incremental builds makes designing in browser a joy.
- **Zero-config entrypoints.**
  Import everything into monolithic CSS and JS bundles? Break out page bundles? Inline critical CSS? YES.
- **No production surprises.**
  CSS and JS behave identically in local dev and production. What you see is what you'll get.
- **No fillers, no additives.**
  Grease keeps it light so you can focus on building instead of messing around with tooling.
- **Fluid, variable type.**
  A straightforward fluid type system pre-loaded for variable fonts keeps your type game on point.
- **Batteries included.**
  Production-ready odds & ends come in the box. Sitemaps, canonical URLs, no-indexing, etc.
