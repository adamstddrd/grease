# Grease
[Grease](https://web-grease.netlify.app) is a website starter that makes building performant, accessible, aesthetic websites fast &amp; frictionless. It uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and includes a lightweight, declarative CSS architecture that sets you up for success.

## Why Grease?
* **designed for in-browser design** - Ultra-fast tools (11ty, Esbuild, Lightning CSS) plus incremental builds makes designing in browser a joy.
* **fluid, variable type** - A straightforward fluid type system pre-loaded for variable fonts keeps your type game on point.
* **no fillers, no additives** - Grease keeps it light so you can focus on building instead of messing around with tools and frameworks.
* **zero-config entrypoints** - Import everything into monolithic CSS and JS bundles? Break out page bundles? Inline critical CSS? YES!
* **no production surprises** - CSS and JS are treated the same on dev as on production (bundled, minified, etc). What you see is what you’ll get.
* **batteries included** - Production-ready odds & ends come in the box. Sitemaps, canonical URLs, search index blocking, etc.

## Local dev
[Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven’t already. Once you’ve cloned this repo, run `npm install` to download the various dependencies. To run the local dev server, run `npm start`. Check your terminal output for the URL, but it’ll default to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) unless that port is already in use.
