# Grease
[Grease](https://grease.aaadaaam.com) combines a trio of ultra-fast tools ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/), and [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)) with a modern, declarative CSS architecture that frees you from browser micro-management. It's light enough for small sites, but has everything you need to tackle large projects without getting bogged down in slow builds, dependency hell, and bloated front-ends. Key benefits:

- **Fast in-browser design.**
  Fast tools and a custom-property-powered composable CSS architecture makes designing in browser a joy, and scaffolding new pages *fast*.
- **Zero-config entrypoints.**
  Import everything into monolithic CSS and JS bundles? Break out page bundles? Inline critical CSS? YES.
- **No fillers, no additives.**
  Grease takes a platform-first approach and keeps dependencies to minimum so you can focus on building, not bundling.
- **Expressive color.**
  Grease includes a comprehensive color system that lets you easily support light & dark mode, custom themes, composable themes, and all of the above.
- **Fluid, variable type.**
  A straightforward fluid type system makes it easy to keep your type game on point across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
- **Batteries included.**
  Production-ready odds & ends come in the box. Sitemaps, canonical URL support, no-index support, metadata, etc.
